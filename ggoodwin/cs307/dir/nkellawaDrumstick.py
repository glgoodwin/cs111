  The length of the drumstick can be chosen by the user.

  The only argument for nkellawaDrumstick is:

  1. the length

  The initial view is looking at the cymbal from the bottom. Of the 
  drumstick. The shaft and tip of the drumstick point back along the
  z-axis. 

  The origin lies in the center of the drumstick shaft.
