 * DATE: 
 *
 * COMMENTS: Creates a buggle World populated with bagels, in a random fashion, so
 * that no bagel is placed in the middle column.
 * Places a buggle in the middle of row one.
 * Sends the buggle out to eat the bagels, according to this rule:
 * In each row, the buggle will eat the bagels to its left or the right, only.
 * Specifically, it will eat the bagels to the right, if there are more bagels
 * to its left than its right. And it will eat the bagels to its left, 
 * if there are more bagels to its left than its right.
 * Each cell that used to contain an eaten bagel, is colored red.
