Assignment 2Computer Science 231Spring 2011Due: Start of class on Thursday, February 10Reading. CLRS Chapter 3, pages 43 -- 64; Appendix A, pages 1145 --1157.CLRS Exercise 2.3-3. Use mathematical induction to show that when n is an exact power of 2, the solution of the recurrenceT(n)=2ifn=2,2T(n/2)+nifn=2k,k>1%Gâ§%@ %Gâ¨%@ %Gâ©%@is T(n) = n lg n. (Hint: Your induction should proceed on k, not on n).Exercise 2.2.a. Suppose algorithm A has worst-case running time O(n) and algorithm B has worst-case running time O(n2 ). What can you say about the relative performance of the algorithms?b. Repeat part a for the worst-case running times †È(n) and †È(n2 ).Exercise 2.3. Find two integer functions f(n) and g(n) such that f(n) is not O(g(n)) and g(n) is not O(f(n)). (An integer function is a function that maps integers to integers.)CLRS Problem 3-3a. You only need to hand in solutions to the 22 functions given below, not the 30 as given in the text.a. Rank the following function by order of growth; that is, find an arrangement g1, g2, . . ., g22 of the functions satisfying g1 = †Ù(g2), g2 = †Ù(g3), . . ., g21 = †Ù(g22), Partition your list into equivalence classes such that f(n) and g(n) are in the same class if and only if f(n) = †È(g(n)). One way to do this is to list functions f(n) and g(n) on the same line if and only if f(n) = †È(g(n)). List all other functions on separate lines in order of their growth rates, fastest growth rates at the top of page.(2)lg n2 n! n3 lg2 n 2n nln(ln n) n·2n ln n 1 2lg n 4lg n(n+1)! ln n n 2n n lg n 2 n+11n 2n+1 n 3nAssignment 2 Page 2Computer Science 231b. Give an example of a single nonnegative function f(n) such that for all functions gi(n) in part a, f(n) is neither O(gi(n)) nor †Ù(gi(n)).Hints. Here are a few relationships between notations that you may find useful.1. Notations f = O(g) and g = †Ù (f) mean exactly the same thing.2. So do notations f = o(g) and g = †ù (f).3. Whenever f = †ù (g), then f = †Ù (g), and similarly, whenever f = o(g) then f = O(g).The converses of these statements do not always hold.4. f = †È (g) if and only if f = O(g) and f = †Ù (g).5. If f = o(g), then it is never the case that f = †Ù (g).6. Similarly, if f = †ù (g), then it is never the case that f = O(g).You should try to understand why each of the above statements is true.
